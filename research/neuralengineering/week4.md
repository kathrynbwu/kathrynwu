### On Cancer, MMAE, and ADCs

On today's monday meeting, we kind of discussed more on cancer and future directions for treatment.

One of the terms thrown around was “Monotreatment.” It refers to using a single compound or drug. In our case, it was to test the various chemo drugs one by one in vivo. This sets us up for the next direction: 

Co-treatment / Combination Treatment:
This involves administering two or more agents at the same time to study synergistic or additive effects. For example, chemotherapy drugs that are paried together can test whether FA reduces chemotherapy-induced damage. Combination therapy is common in oncology because different drugs often target different pathways, increasing cancer cell kill rates and reduces the risk of drug resistance.

This brings me to one of my questions: **can FA be used with another drug to work against neuropathy in the same way, by targeting different pathways to mitigate?** One that has been on my mind is a drug in combination with ESTIM, where both have mitochondrial trafficking boost effects.

Radiation therapy delivers high-energy beams (like X-rays or protons) focused on a specific tumor site to kill cancer cells or shrink the tumor, often before surgery. It is localized, meaning it primarily affects the area being targeted and works when there is a corresponding targeted area.

Chemotherapy uses cytotoxic drugs that circulate systemically through the bloodstream. It is particularly useful when there's a risk that cancer has metastasized (spread to other organs), because it targets rapidly dividing cells throughout the body.

When cancer progresses to late stages, the tumor burden is often large and infiltrates critical organs or blood vessels. This makes surgery, chemo, or radiation dangerous. Radiation may cause necrosis (tissue death) or rupture of nearby arteries, leading to hemorrhage. Chemotherapy can weaken healthy tissue, impair organ function, and further destabilize the patient, especially if capillaries and vasculature are fragile.

In such cases, cytostatic treatments (which halt cell division, rather than kill cells) are used. These block the cell cycle, effectively “freezing” cancer cells in a non-dividing state. The tumor remains, but proliferation slows dramatically, giving time for other interventions or palliative care.

The “mother tumor” produces growth-suppressing signals to keep micrometastases (tiny offshoots of the cancer) dormant. If the large tumor is surgically removed too early, these suppressive signals are lost and dormant cancer cells may "wake up" and begin proliferating aggressively, leading to relapse or metastasis. Therefore, doctors often shrink the tumor first using radiation/chemo before removal, minimizing this risk.

A conjugated drug is a targeted therapy where a cytotoxic compound is chemically linked (conjugated) to an antibody or ligand that recognizes a specific receptor or antigen on cancer cells. These are called Antibody–Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The antibody guides the drug to the cancer cell. Once bound, the complex is internalized (endocytosis), and the drug is released inside the cell, where it can kill it, sparing healthy tissue.

MMAE (Monomethyl auristatin E) is a potent anti-mitotic agent, meaning it prevents cells from dividing by blocking tubulin polymerization.

Because it’s too toxic to administer freely, MMAE is used as the payload in ADCs. ADCs have only become clinically widespread in the last 5–10 years, but show enormous promise, especially in hematologic cancers and HER2-positive cancers.

We were tasked to do more background research on MMAE and ADCs in a google doc. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9AY8S70DBB8DRqPgXBnlrd3T7te4tfVsOVgHUqNFhI/edit?tab=t.0), we went over what MMAE and ADCs are, and why MMAE is used only as a monotherapy.

I had a few more questions, though, which I asked to ChatGPT:

1. Would the effects of chemo drugs in vivo be different depending on whether or not the rat has cancer?

Yes, absolutely. In a healthy rat, chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin or paclitaxel primarily damage healthy dividing cells (e.g., in bone marrow, gut, or nervous system), leading to side effects without therapeutic benefit. In a cancer-bearing rat, those same drugs target both healthy and cancerous cells, which makes studying tumor shrinkage and systemic toxicity more meaningful. So, researchers use both healthy and tumor-bearing animals to understand therapeutic effect vs. toxicity, often looking for protective agents (like FA) that reduce side effects without protecting the tumor.

2. Why don't we "freeze" cancer cells sooner or in tandem with drugs?

Cytostatic therapies don’t reduce tumor size significantly, so they are often used after other treatments fail, especially for palliative care or maintenance. They also require very precise timing and understanding of the tumor’s cell cycle and genetic background. However, research is growing into combination approaches where cytostatic agents are used with chemo or immunotherapy to slow growth and enhance vulnerability to other drugs.
