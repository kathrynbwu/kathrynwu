## TL;DR

Weeks 1â€“3 document my technical training in the complete fabrication workflow of the dual chamber microchannel device, which is used to isolate and selectively treat parts of the neuron (1); the sterilization, substrate preparation, and media coating required to create a biocompatible microenvironment conducive to neuronal adhesion and growth (2); and the fluorescent microscope imaging and data acquisition techniques (3).
