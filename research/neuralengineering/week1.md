In my first conversation with Dr. In Hong Yang, he posed a query to me: if there was a wire suspended in a rectangular prism of water (or any aqueous solution as he clarified upon my further query) and we wanted to isolate dyes on either side so that they do not mix, how would I go about doing that? My response involved something like turning the prism onto its smallest face so that it stands vertically, securing the wire, and using different densities of solution to dye either side.

He instead showed me this paper by Robert Campenot of the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. In 1977, he pioneered the Campenot Chamber method. His device used Teflon‑separated compartments on a glass coverslip, with fine scratches to guide neurite growth across fluid‑impermeable barriers. Neurons in one compartment could receive treatments (e.g., nerve growth factor on distal axons) while the cell bodies remained protected in the other, famously demonstrated in the PNAS paper [*Local control of neurite development by nerve growth factor*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.74.10.4516).

Dr. Yang further emphasized that this method was used for a lengthy 30 years. That is, until the early 2000s, when microfabrication offered a higher-precision upgrade. This new device uses SU‑8 photolithography and PDMS soft lithography. I don’t quite remember the exact example he showed me. Still, I am fairly certain it was this one: [*Dual-compartment neurofluidic system for electrophysiological measurements in physically segregated and functionally connected neuronal cell culture*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroengineering/articles/10.3389/fneng.2011.00013/) by Kanagasabapathi et al., 2011. They used the method that we use in our lab, with the same geometry and cell‑seeding protocol.
